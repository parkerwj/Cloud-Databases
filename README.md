# Overview

This project aims to further my learning on how to integrate a cloud database into a program. The software created is a photo editing database management program that allows photographers to add/update sessions, track the number of images edited, and calculate amounts due. The program is integrated with a Firebase Cloud Database to allow for easy access and sharing of data among different users.

# Cloud Database

The program uses a Firebase Cloud Database to store all data. The database has a collection called "photographers" which contains documents for each photographer. Each document has fields for the photographer's name, website, email, and their sessions. The sessions field is a subcollection that contains documents for each session with fields for session type, is_paid, session name, session date, delivered date, number of images, price per image, and return date.

# Development Environment

This program was developed using Python 3.11.5. The Firebase Python SDK was used to access the Cloud Database.
